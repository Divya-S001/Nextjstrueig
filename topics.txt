           	1. Basics of Next.js
Objective: Understand the foundational concepts of Next.js. 
Learn:
What is Next.js and why it's used.
Key features: SSR (Server-Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation), and Client-Side Rendering.
Performance Benefits of SSR & When to Use It
Hydration Issues & Fixes
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
Edge Functions & Middleware in Next.js
Practice:
Set up a basic Next.js project.
Build simple pages using the traditional pages directory.

2. Transition to App Router
Objective: Familiarize yourself with the App Router and its differences from the pages directory.
Learn:
Differences between the pages directory and the app directory.
Concept of server and client components in the App Router.
Practice:
Set up a Next.js project with the App Router (app directory).
Create basic routes using the app directory.

3. Routing and Layouts
Objective: Understand how routing works with the App Router and the concept of nested layouts.
Learn:
The role of layout.js for creating shared layouts.
How to define dynamic routes ([id]/page.js) and catch-all routes ([...slug]/page.js).
Default behaviors like loading states (loading.js) and error handling (error.js).
Practice:
Create a nested layout structure.
Build pages with dynamic routes.

4. Server and Client Components
Objective: Master the separation of concerns in Next.js with server and client components.
Learn:
When to use server components (default) and client components ('use client' directive).
How data fetching works differently in server components.
Practice:
Create a data-driven server component using fetch.
Use a client component for interactivity (e.g., a form).

5. Data Fetching and Caching
Objective: Explore advanced data fetching and caching mechanisms.
Learn:
How to fetch data with getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, or directly in server components.
Static and dynamic rendering options for server components.
Cache strategies with the revalidate property.
Practice:
Build a page that fetches and displays API data.
Add revalidation logic for fresh data.

6. Middleware and API Routes
Objective: Leverage middleware and build backend APIs in Next.js.
Learn:
How to use middleware.js for authentication or request handling.
Create and use API routes (app/api/route.js).
Practice:
Implement middleware for authentication.
Create a simple REST API in the app/api folder.

7. Optimizing Performance
Objective: Learn performance optimizations in Next.js.
Learn:
Code splitting with server and client components.
Image optimization using next/image.
Prefetching routes for faster navigation.
Practice:
Optimize images on your website.
Test and improve page load speed.

8. Styling and Customization
Objective: Style your application effectively.
Learn:
CSS Modules, Styled Components, or Tailwind CSS.
Implementing custom themes with dark/light modes.
Practice:
Create a styled layout with Tailwind CSS or a CSS-in-JS library.
